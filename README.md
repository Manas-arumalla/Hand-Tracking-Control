# Hand-Tracking-Control

This repository demonstrates a **hand tracking and gesture-based control system** using computer vision and machine learning.  
The system captures a live video feed, detects and tracks hand landmarks, classifies gestures, and maps them into real-time control commands for external applications.

## Project Overview
The core idea is to use **human hand gestures as a natural interface** for controlling machines. Instead of relying on physical devices like joysticks or remotes, a simple camera can act as the input medium, enabling a contactless and intuitive form of interaction.

This project integrates:
- **Hand detection and tracking** from live video.  
- **Gesture recognition** using extracted landmarks as features.  
- **Gesture-to-command mapping** for customizable control.  
- **Real-time execution** of commands on external systems.

## Applications
- **Robotics** â†’ control movement or tasks using gestures.  
- **Drone navigation** â†’ map gestures to drone flight commands.  
- **Virtual environments** â†’ interact with AR/VR or desktop interfaces.  
- **Assistive technology** â†’ hands-free control for accessibility.

## What Is Beign Done
1. **Hand Detection & Tracking**  
   Identifying hands in the camera feed and extracting landmarks such as finger joints and wrist positions.  

2. **Gesture Recognition**  
   Classifying different hand poses or movements (e.g., open palm, fist, thumbs up, pinch).  

3. **Gesture-to-Command Mapping**  
   Associating recognized gestures with specific commands, which can be customized by the user.  

4. **Control Execution**  
   Sending commands to robots, drones, or other applications to create a real-time, gesture-driven control system.

## ðŸŒŸ Why This Matters
- Enables a **contactless, intuitive interface** for machines.  
- Reduces reliance on traditional hardware controllers.  
- Provides a versatile platform for **robotics, AR/VR, gaming, and accessibility**.  
- Demonstrates how **computer vision + ML + control systems** can be combined into a practical solution.
